## About me

üëã My name is Guillem, a passionate Full Stack developer who has been immersed in the world of computer science since 2010.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies and platforms. Between 2019 and 2020, I completed a course in Microcomputer Systems Support, which allowed me to start my own business focused on computer and mobile device repairs.

Since 2021, I have been working as a freelancer, tackling a wide range of projects including website development, mobile applications, REST APIs, Microservices, and more. I have also led some teams.

That same year, I co-founded KenaBot, the largest music bot in the Spanish-speaking Discord community with over 19 million users. As owner and Tech Lead, I manage team development and collaboration using microservices in Go, microfrontends in Next.js, Docker, GitHub, Notion, Figma, and agile methodologies like Kanban.
